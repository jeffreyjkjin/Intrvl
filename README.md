# Intrvl
![Demo](/intrvl.gif)

[Intrvl](https://intrvl.vercel.app/) is a simple and customizable interval timer that can be used for any activity that requires timing intervals such as exercising or studying.

Intrvl was built using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Dexie](https://dexie.org/) for the database, [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling, and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) for development.

I developed Intrvl because I wasn't able to find any interval timer apps that I could use for my workouts which didn't have a ton of ads and or micro-transactions but could also be customized to suit my needs. Thus, I knew I had to create one myself.
